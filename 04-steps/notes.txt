--- STATE

- basically data that a component can hold over time.
- Whenever a state variable is updated, it triggers react to update component

- HOOKS start with use* e.g useState, useEffect, useReducer.
- SHOULD be call only on top level of the component.

When there a need to update state, should always do so by passing a callback function
wrong way: setSomething(s+1);
correct way: setSomething( (s) => s + 1 )
